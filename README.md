# GLoMo in Tensorflow

This repo only covers the graph predictor and feature predictor, which are the main parts of 2018 NIPS paper:
<br>[`Yang, Zhilin, et al. "GLoMo: Unsupervisedly Learned Relational Graphs as Transferable Representations." arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05662 (2018).`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05662)
<br> Since the author has not yet release the official code, this repo is only based on personal understanding of the paper, which could  be mis-understood or incomplete, we do not recommand a direct usage of this repo at this moment.
<br> This repo will be continually updated, and after the official code released, we will re-implement GLoMo according to its official version asap!

<br>**Requirements:**
<br>  python: 3.6
<br>  tensorflow: >=1.4.0
<br>  CUDA-Toolkits: >=8.0

<br>**TODO:**
<br>  0.Modification on the implementation of graph predictor and feature predictor
<br>  1.Bi-attention mechanism in RNN
<br>  2.Downstream task models
<br>  3.Training on various tasks
