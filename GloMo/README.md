# GLoMo in Tensorflow

This project only covers the graph predictor and feature predictor, which are the main parts of paper:
<br>[`Yang, Zhilin, et al. "GLoMo: Unsupervisedly Learned Relational Graphs as Transferable Representations." arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05662 (2018).`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05662)
<br> Since the author has not yet release the official code, this repo is only based on the limited information in the paper, which could very likely to be mis-understood or incomplete.
<br> This repo will be continuely updated!

<br>**TODO:**
<br>  0.Modification on the implementation of graph predictor and feature predictor
<br>  1.Bi-attention mechanism in RNN
<br>  2.Downstream task models
<br>  3.Training on various tasks
